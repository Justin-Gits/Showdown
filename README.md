This project is a work-in progress for my first-person shooter game titled "Snapshot".  

Game Overview:

An online PVP arena style shooter that will pit two players in head-to-head combat in a fast-paced futuristic shooter. With instant-respawn mechanics based on the player's position 10 seconds in the past, 
this game will force players to push their opponent into the past and out of the arena by any means necessary. Will you challenge your opponent in traditional head-to-head combat, or will you utilize your 
time mechanics to ambush your opponent as they spawn? Positioning is just as critical as timing in this unique landscape. 


Current Progress:
Almost complete with Version 1.0 of game (Basic features) that establishes synchronized networked multiplayer movement (even with high lag situations) and the time spawning mechanic.  Can provide game outline and 
roadmap upon request.
